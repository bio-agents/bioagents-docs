Contributors Guide
==================

bio.agents community site
------------------------
**GitHub** is used for sharing code and data for all *bio.agents*-related projects:

- https://github.com/bio-agents/
- https://github.com/bio-agents/bioagents-schema
- https://github.com/bio-agents/bioagentsregistry
- https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology

Feature requests & issues
-------------------------
GitHub is used to track **fine-grained issues** and is the preferred way to make *bio.agents* feature requests, content suggestions, EDAM term requests, and bug reports:

- https://github.com/bio-agents/bioagentsregistry/issues
- https://github.com/bio-agents/bioagents-schema/issues
- https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/issues

.. note:: GitHub is the primary means for technical coordination: collaborators are encouraged to browse tasks, review priorities, make comments and add new tasks.  

Hangouts
--------
`Coordination meetings <http://bioagents.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hangouts.html>`_ are organised as required. The hangouts usually have an open agenda and respond to current critical needs.  Technical representatives of IECHOR-DK institutes routinely attend and everyone is very welcome: if you'd like to join  `email us <mailto:help@bio.agents>`_.  

 
Editing agent descriptions
-------------------------
You can contribute to *bio.agents* directly:

- register your own (or other people's) agents
- request edit rights (via a button on the *bio.agents* Agent Cards) on entries where agents are already registered 
- request ownership (again via a button) of entries, if you are the developer of the agent described but it has been registerd by someone else
- ask for help via the email, especially in case you have many agents to add or edits to make


bio.agents benefits from the support of IECHOR Nodes: collections of research institutes from a member country that provide the resources and services that are part of IECHOR.
